        <b>#1:</b> Use waterproof mascara to hold a lash curl. It will act like a perm for your eyelashes and seal in the curl, 
        according to Maybelline New York Global Makeup Artist Erin Parsons. 
      </p>

      <p style="color: maroon;">
        <b>#2:</b> After you finish painting your nails, use ice water to help them dry faster. 
      </p>

      <p style="color: maroon;">
        <b>#3:</b> You can make any regular, creamy lipstick look matte with loose powder and a tissue. 
        Simply fill in your lips with your desired color, place a tissue over the lipstick and brush powder 
        over top of the tissue. The powder soaks up the shine and gives your favorite lipstick a smooth matte finish. 
      </p>

      <p style="color: maroon;">
        <b>#4:</b> Store makeup wipes upside down (with the opening facing down) to keep them from drying out. 
        According to makeup artist Kelli Bartlett, this will help the product thoroughly soak through every towelette, 
        starting with the one you’re going to use next. 
      </p>
      <p style="color: maroon;">
        <b>#5:</b> To master the perfect everyday winged eyeliner, start your line at the outer corner of your eyelid. 
        Then, once you have your desired length, begin to fill in the wing. Much to contrary belief, you don’t have to carry 
        the line through to the inner corner of your eye, says Parsons.

      <p style="color: maroon;">
        <b>#6:</b> For flawless lip liner application every time, use this Cupid’s bow hack. 
        It will help you apply even, smooth liner on the mark on your first try.  
      </p>

      <p style="color: maroon;">
        <b>#7:</b> Get rid of flaky lips with a DIY lip scrub made of coconut oil and brown sugar. 
        Because exfoliated lips are key to flawless lipstick application, you won’t want to miss this step in your beauty prep routine.   
      </p>

      <p style="color: maroon;">
        <b>#8:</b> Sleep on your back to avoid waking up with puffy eyes in the morning and keep wrinkles away in the long-run.    
      </p>

      <p style="color: maroon;">
        <b>#9:</b> Hold a business card, spoon or tissue behind your eyelashes when applying mascara to prevent the productfrom getting on your eyelids, 
        especially if you just finished a glam eyeshadow look.     
      </p>

      <p style="color: maroon;">
        <b>#10:</b> Braid your wet or dry hair at night before you go to sleep to wake up with beachy waves in the morning. 
        Setting your hair overnight is the perfect way to save a few minutes when you wake up.
      </p>

      <p style="color: maroon;">
        <b>#11:</b> Get a dewy glow by mixing your moisturizer in with your foundation. It’s the perfect way to make a full-coverage 
        foundation a little more sheer and comfortable to wear throughout the day. P.S.: This hack also works with face oil.
      </p>

      <p style="color: maroon;">
        <b>#12:</b> Wet your eyeshadow brush with a setting spray before applying shadow so it has more staying power and the color is more pigmented. 
      </p>

      <p style="color: maroon;">
        <b>#13:</b> Parsons recommends applying winged eyeliner with your eyes open, facing a mirror. 
        This trick will help you get your wings symmetrical on both sides. 
      </p>

      <p style="color: maroon;">
        <b>#14:</b> Packing on the heavy eyeshadow? Use tape under your eyes to catch any fallout and keep the color off of your cheeks. 
      </p>

      <p style="color: maroon;">
        <b>#15:</b> To clean up any makeup mistakes, especially around your eyes, use a Q-tip dipped in micellar water, says makeup 
        artist <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/jonetwmakeup/">Jonet Williamson</a>.
